### SPOUT

<a href="https://github.com/leadedge/leadedge.github.io/blob/gh-pages/SpoutUserManual.pdf" target="_blank">Spout</a> is a frame sharing system for Microsoft Windows, which allows sharing of graphics between applications in a similar way to [Syphon](http://syphon.v002.info/) for the Mac. Spout supports DirectX 9, DirectX 11 and OpenGL textures and includes a developer SDK and sample applications. The Spout installer will set up a folder on your system that contains all the information required to develop your own applications as well as pre-built plugins, programs and utilities required for correct operation.

### SPOUT CONTROLS

<a href="https://github.com/leadedge/leadedge.github.io/blob/gh-pages/SpoutControls.pdf" target="_blank">SpoutControls</a> is a programmer aid to develop a controlled Spout Sender that will react to controls specific to the application. Examples for Openframeworks, Cinder and Processing can be used as a guide for developing others. The “SpoutController” FreeframeGL plugin adapts it’s user interface to that of the Sender so that you can forget about the sender app itself.
