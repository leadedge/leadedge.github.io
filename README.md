## SPOUT

“Spout” is a video frame sharing system for Microsoft Windows, which allows sharing of OpenGL textures between applications in a similar way to [Syphon](http://syphon.v002.info/) for the Mac. Spout supports DirectX 9, DirectX 11 and OpenGL textures and includes a developer SDK and sample applications. Read the [Documentation](https://github.com/leadedge/Spout2/blob/master/SpoutSDK/Documentation/SpoutSDK.pdf).   
**[Download](https://github.com/leadedge/Spout2/releases/download/2.006/Spout_2006_update-3.zip)**  
 The Spout installer will set up a folder on your system that contains all the information required to develop your own applications as well as pre-built plugins, programs and utilities required for correct operation.

### SPOUT CONTROLS

“SpoutControls” is a programmer aid to develop a controlled Spout Sender that will react to controls specific to the application. Examples for Openframeworks, Cinder and Processing can be used as a guide for developing others. The “SpoutController” FreeframeGL plugin adapts it’s user interface to that of the Sender so that you can forget about the sender app itself. Read the [Documentation](https://github.com/leadedge/SpoutControls/blob/master/SpoutControls.pdf).

### SPOUT TO NDI

“Spout to NDI” is a set of programs that allow Spout senders and receivers to share video, not only with each other but also by way of a network using <a href="https://newtek.com/ndi" target="_blank">NewTek NDI</a> (“Network Device Interface”) protocol.
