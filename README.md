## SPOUT

“Spout” is a video frame sharing system for Microsoft Windows, which allows sharing of OpenGL textures between applications in a similar way to [Syphon](http://syphon.v002.info/) for the Mac. Spout supports DirectX 9, DirectX 11 and OpenGL textures and includes a developer SDK and sample applications.
