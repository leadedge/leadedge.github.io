### SPOUT

<a href="https://github.com/leadedge/leadedge.github.io/blob/gh-pages/SpoutUserManual.pdf" target="_blank">Spout</a> is a frame sharing system for Microsoft Windows, which allows sharing of graphics between applications in a similar way to [Syphon](http://syphon.v002.info/) for the Mac. Spout supports DirectX 9, DirectX 11 and OpenGL textures. The installer includes a virtual webcam, utility programs, a developer SDK with sample applications and saves system settings required for correct operation.

### SPOUT CONTROLS

<a href="https://github.com/leadedge/leadedge.github.io/blob/gh-pages/SpoutControls.pdf" target="_blank">SpoutControls</a> is a programmer aid to develop a Spout sender that will control a Spout receiver. A SpoutController FreeframeGL receiver plugin is provided that adapts it’s application user interface to that of the Sender so that you can use it as if the sender was a stand-alone plugin and forget about the sender app itself. Examples for Openframeworks, Cinder and Processing can be used as a guide for developing others.
