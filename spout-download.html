	<p>The latest update is a new release - Spout 2.007.</br>
	The installation file is the same as previously. Just unzip the download file anywhere and run "SpoutSettings". This allows you to set up options for Spout texture sharing. New demonstration sender and receiver applications can be used for testing with your system.</br></br>
	Download the zip archive below and extract to any convenient folder.<br>
	Refer to Setup.pdf in the archive for installation.</br></br>
	The previous 2.006 download still be found <a href="https://github.com/leadedge/leadedge.github.io/raw/downloads/Spout_2006_update-4.zip">here.</a> Again, run SpoutSettings once to change back for testing. To return to 2.007 do the same in the "Spout 2.007" download folder. You can go back and forth in this way.
