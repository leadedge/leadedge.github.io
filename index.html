	<h1>SpoutControls</h1>
	<p>
	SpoutControls enables a Spout receiver to control a Spout sender. A C++ class enables programmers to develop a controlled Spout Sender with C++ or Processing that will react to user controls specific to the application from a Spout controller.
	<br><br>
	<b>SpoutController.dll</b> is a FreeframeGL Spout Receiver plugin that controls a Spout sender. The plugin provided with the original SpoutControls 1.010 <a href="https://github.com/leadedge/leadedge.github.io/raw/downloads/SpoutControls_setup_V1.010.zip">  distribution</a> is built for FreeframeGL 1.6 and requires a compatible host, such as <a href="https://magicmusicvisuals.com/">Magic Music Visuals</a>. 
	<br><br>
	This version is not compatible with <a href="https://resolume.com/">Resolume 7</a> which uses FreeframeGL 2. <b>SpoutController2.dll</b> is built with FreeframeGL 2.0 and can be used in place of the FreeframeGL 1.6 version. Unzip the <a href="https://github.com/leadedge/leadedge.github.io/raw/downloads/SpoutControls_V2.023.zip">distribution file</a> to any convenient folder. This contains examples and documentation.
